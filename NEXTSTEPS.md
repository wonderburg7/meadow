# Next steps

<!-- CONTEXT: current-queue | LOAD: every session -->

Five ready slices in two lanes, refilled 3 Sep 2026 after HC-9 landed.

**Everything in this file can be started right now.** Nothing here is waiting
on a hands-on check, a live repro, or a decision from Dave. Work that *is*
waiting is listed under "Not in the queue" at the bottom, with a pointer, and
is deliberately not mixed in above.

**"Implement the next slice" means:** take the first unclaimed item in your
lane, open only the `Plan:` file and heading it names, add your row to
`plans/workstreams.md`, branch, implement, run `tools/verify.ps1`, and close
with the end-of-slice report (`CLAUDE.md`, "End-of-slice report"). Do not read
the other lane's plan, the archive, `ROADMAP.md` or Git history to work out
what to do -- this file already decided.

## Next up

1. **[Claude] FL-1 -- The flower panel says nothing about age or season.**
   - Plan: `plans/now/flowers.md` -- Slice 1.
   - Does: `hud.gd::_refresh_flower_summary()` already rebuilds the flower
     summary panel every frame it's open and already prints both effective
     rates, but says nothing about age or season. Builds one extra line --
     age in days against lifespan, and "in season (NN%)" / "out of season" /
     "seasons off" -- and puts it in `trait_label` above the scent-mark text
     (joined with a newline, not replacing it) using `age_seconds`,
     `lifespan_seconds` and `season_strength()`, all already public on
     `flower.gd`. Nothing new is computed in `flower.gd`.
   - Files: `scripts/hud.gd`.
   - Check: `tools/verify.ps1`. One hands-on check to file: click a flower
     and the panel shows its age against its lifespan and whether it's in
     or out of season; watching one across a season boundary flips the line
     at the same moment the `+/s` figures fall away.
   - Why first: it shares no file with X3, HC-9 landed and
     `plans/now/hive-comb.md` has nothing else ready.
   - Next after: FL-2 (`plans/now/flowers.md` Slice 2) -- a balance change,
     needs its named headless run before it merges.

2. **[Codex] X3 -- Buttons that read as buttons at rest, game-wide.**
   - Plan: `plans/now/ui.md` -- UI-P-2.
   - Does: raise `ui_theme.gd::_refresh_button_stylebox()`'s `"normal"` state
     from `base.lightened(0.10)` toward 0.16-0.18 and/or give it a low-alpha
     border, so "Change to..." and "When idle:" (and every other command-panel
     button) show a background at rest. One shared value, not a per-menu
     override.
   - Files: `scripts/ui_theme.gd`.
   - Check: `tools/verify.ps1`. One hands-on check to file: ordinary buttons
     read as buttons at rest, and `mark_as_current` buttons still read as
     clearly more prominent.
   - Why first in this lane: it was already at the head of the queue and
     shares no file with anything in the Claude lane.
   - Next after: UI-R-2.

3. **[Claude] SP-1 -- Picking a Scenario wipes settings the player set by
   hand.**
   - Plan: `plans/now/settings-persistence.md` -- Slice 1.
   - Does: `main.gd::_on_scenario_chosen` calls
     `SettingsCatalogue.reset_config_to_defaults()`, which writes the default
     back over every `GameConfig` field -- including toggles the player set
     themselves. Records the key set each `ScenarioPresets.apply()` wrote,
     adds `reset_config_keys()` beside the full reset, and resets only the
     union of the outgoing preset's keys and the incoming one's.
   - Files: `scripts/main.gd`, `scripts/scenario_presets.gd`,
     `scripts/settings_catalogue.gd`.
   - Check: `tools/verify.ps1`. One hands-on check to file: a hand-set
     flower/season toggle survives picking a Scenario, and preset A's values
     do not leak into preset B's run.
   - Why here: it was the Claude lane's head before C1-14 arrived, and it
     shares no file with anything else in the queue.
   - Next after: FL-1 (`plans/now/flowers.md` Slice 1).

4. **[Codex] UI-R-2 -- Pre-run menu: the left edge still needs more room.**
   - Plan: `plans/now/ui.md` -- UI-R-2.
   - Does: raises `main_menu.gd`'s `LEFT_PANE_MARGIN` from 16 to 32. One
     constant; nothing about tile size, spacing, centres or hit-testing
     changes, so UI-M and UI-P-3 cannot regress.
   - Files: `scripts/main_menu.gd`.
   - Check: `tools/verify.ps1`. One hands-on check to file: the left pane
     sits comfortably clear of the screen edge and tile clicking is
     unchanged.
   - Next after: UI-R-3.

5. **[Codex] UI-R-3 -- No way to fire a warning-banner case on demand.**
   - Plan: `plans/now/ui.md` -- UI-R-3.
   - Does: adds a second button, "Fire test warnings", to
     `debug_panel.gd`'s existing `challenge_row` beside "Advance Challenge
     stage", styled with the same `_style_button` + `UI.with_info` pattern.
     It calls `hud.show_warning` three times off one `SceneTreeTimer`
     chain -- an epitaph-keyed message at t=0, a crab-spider-escape-keyed
     one at t=+8s and an unkeyed confirmation at t=+10s -- using the real
     `problem_messages.gd` entries and `GameConfig` gaps, not literals.
     Developer section only, so ordinary play cannot reach it.
   - Files: `scripts/debug_panel.gd`.
   - Check: `tools/verify.ps1`. It also unblocks `checks/blocked.md`'s C-4;
     move that entry to `checks/ready.md`, keeping its id, when this lands.
   - Next after: UI-S-1.

## Ready, not yet in the queue

All of these can be started today; they are out of the queue only because it
holds five. Take one when a lane empties, in roughly this order.

- **UI-S-1** (`plans/now/ui.md`) -- the bottom row re-specified: the command
  tray takes half the viewport, centred, and the summary panel and Dr
  Gallerin's bubble fill what is left with one 16px gap each. Supersedes
  UI-R-1's own check.
- **UI-S-2** (`plans/now/ui.md`) -- the colony, foraging and nursery windows
  sit below the corner readout with a 16px buffer, scroll when they do not
  fit, and close each other.
- **UI-S-3** (`plans/now/ui.md`) -- the command tray shrinks again when
  "More..." is closed, and never runs off the bottom of the screen.
- **UI-S-4** (`plans/now/ui.md`) -- a second right-click sometimes does
  nothing and appears to deselect the bee: instrument the command choke
  point and make a refused command say so.
- **FL-2** (`plans/now/flowers.md` Slice 2) -- out of season means a small
  non-zero rate, faster ageing and rarer seeding. A balance change: it needs
  its named headless run before it merges.
- **C2-1** (`plans/now/challenge-2.md` Slice 1) -- a debug button that forces
  a Challenge 2 nectar collapse, so C-5 can be run at all.
- **P-1** (`plans/now/check-loop.md`) -- make `checks/ready.md`'s new entry
  format (id, one action, one PASS line, an owner) enforceable in
  `tools/check_docs.py`.

## Not in the queue, and why

Each of these needs something from Dave, or something else to ship first.
They are listed so they are not lost, not so they are picked up.

- **Challenge 1 Slice 7** (`plans/now/challenge-1.md`) -- the acceptance
  playthrough. C1-15 landed 3 Sep 2026; this is now Dave's run and the last
  thing that plan needs.
- **Challenge 2 Slice 2** (`plans/now/challenge-2.md`) -- fixing whichever
  of the rescue and recovery lines does not appear. Needs C2-1 to ship and
  Dave to press the button; there is no static defect to fix blind, and
  guessing has already failed twice.
- **check-loop P-2 and P-3** (`plans/now/check-loop.md`) -- the panel-rect
  source check runs after UI-S-1 and UI-S-2 move the numbers; the shared
  developer-trigger section runs after UI-R-3 and C2-1 exist to collect.
- **Hive comb Slices 4 and 5** (`plans/now/hive-comb.md`) -- Slice 4's
  headless trace found the mechanism (every idle Comb Worker piles onto one
  unfinished site), but capping builders per site changes build throughput,
  so it needs Dave's live look and a call on intended behaviour. Slice 5
  needs its own live repro.
- **UI-P-5 and UI-D** (`plans/now/ui.md`) -- both name two plausible causes
  and say to reproduce live before changing code.
- **Save/load during an active Challenge** (`DESIGN_BACKLOG.md`) -- `SaveGame`
  has no Challenge stage/gate/prompt schema, which is why save and load are
  greyed out for the length of Challenge 2. Confirmed working as built on
  2 Sep; changing it is a separate high-risk design task.
- **Progression Phase A** (`plans/design/progression.md`) -- designed, not
  scheduled; parked behind the settings-catalogue work by Dave's 1 Sep call.
